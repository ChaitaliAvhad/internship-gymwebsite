project objective-create pricing landing page using html, css, javascript(optionally)
Project Description: 
For my internship project, I have developed a dynamic and visually appealing gym website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases various features and functionalities that provide an immersive experience for gym enthusiasts. 
Key Features:
1. Membership Plans: We offer a variety of membership plans to cater to different needs and fitness goals. Our pricing landing page provides a clear breakdown of each membership plan, including the duration, features, and pricing details. Users can easily compare the plans and choose the one that suits them best.

2. Pricing Comparison Table: To make it easier for users to understand and compare the different membership plans, we have included a pricing comparison table. This table presents a side-by-side comparison of the features offered in each plan, allowing users to make an informed decision.

3. Pricing Details: We understand the importance of transparency when it comes to pricing. Our pricing landing page provides detailed information about what is included in each membership plan, such as access to gym facilities, group classes, personal training sessions, and additional perks.

By leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we have created a pricing landing page that effectively communicates the value and benefits of our membership plans. The page is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and optimized for conversions.

Throughout the development process, I have focused on creating a seamless and engaging user experience while adhering to best practices in front-end development. The project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and my ability to design and develop a functional and visually appealing website.
